DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Filter2D_U0/filter2D_hls_mac_ibs_U34/filter2D_hls_mac_ibs_DSP48_1_U/p input Filter2D_U0/filter2D_hls_mac_ibs_U34/filter2D_hls_mac_ibs_DSP48_1_U/p/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Filter2D_U0/p_Val2_4_0_1_i_reg_2052_reg input Filter2D_U0/p_Val2_4_0_1_i_reg_2052_reg/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Filter2D_U0/tmp21_reg_2058_reg input Filter2D_U0/tmp21_reg_2058_reg/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Filter2D_U0/tmp26_reg_2064_reg input Filter2D_U0/tmp26_reg_2064_reg/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP Block_Mat_exit38794_U0/filter2D_hls_mul_bkb_U1/filter2D_hls_mul_bkb_MulnS_0_U/buff0_reg output Block_Mat_exit38794_U0/filter2D_hls_mul_bkb_U1/filter2D_hls_mul_bkb_MulnS_0_U/buff0_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>
